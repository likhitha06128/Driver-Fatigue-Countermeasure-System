 First, the system gathers real-time data from the drivers. It then assesses the tiredness of the drivers based on the EAR and MAR values obtained from the userâ€™s photographs received from webcam or input video.

It depicts the normal state of the driver where EAR and Yawn values are above and below the threshold values respectively.
It describes that driver is in Yawning State whose Yawn value is above the respective threshold value and isalerted in the form of sound or an alarm.

It describes that driver is Closing his eyes whose EAR value is below the respective threshold value and is alerted in the form of sound or an alarm.
During night time, drivers wear night vision glasses for better view of the road.So,in that case we might not find the eye landmarks of the driver accurately.So,with the help of yawn values we analyze the fatigue state of the driver.

When the driver feels sleepy or drowsy, he/she generally tends to place the hand on the mouth while yawning.In this case,we might not find the mouth landmarks accurately.So,with the help of EAR values we analyze the
fatigue state of the driver.
